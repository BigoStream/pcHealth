## What is the main purpose?
pcHealth is an executable .bat file, which gives you the possibility to check your Windows installation. It can scan, log any problems, check your battery and can try to repair your 'corrupted' Windows installation.

## How to use?
First of all I want to thank your for installing/using my .bat script.
It's quite a handy tool for any IT'er or other computer related problem solving/troubleshooting.

### Now more information on how to use it;
- Right-click and run the .bat file in Administrator mode.
- Read the lines carefully.
- Enter in a number to run the desired command - (Number + ENTER)
- Patiently wait for the script to finish, it will have a positive or a negative outcome.
- If it's negative try and run it again, or start with the DISM command, in case you started with '1'.
- If it worked and repaired the system, reboot your system and try to run the first command again.
- Now it should say that there are no files found that needed any repairing.

- When running a battery report, it should save the file/log in your main :C disk.

## Win_Scan
Yes, Win_Scan is my other repository, but the function that Win_Scan does has been implemented here... 
So you can use both, I'll keep both of them up, but this one will be more advanced when it's finished.
