## 06-12-2021

Reformatted the code, to make it easier for other dev's to start working on it or to understand what it does.

Reworked the DISM code, so it doesn't try to display a log that is made with the SFC command.

## 03-12-2021

Changed some code to make it more streamlined.
Added some new menu's to navigate through.

Made it possible to open logs ect, this was already possible but I optimized the way it works.

Added a new file to the documentation folder; 'releases.md.'
This keeps track on the latest releases.

Also there has been a new release of this script.

- Alpha Release - v.0.1.2-alpha

Oh ooh, made a typo, resolved it!

## 02-12-2021

So people won't have to navigate to the file to check the script.

Tweaked so there is an extra 'space' behind the ENTER function.

Added a function to open the CBS.log that will be generated when there is a corruption detected.
User will get the option to open it or to skip it.

When a log has been generated, user will the option to re-open it via the 'main' menu.
Visual interface has been tweaked too.

## 01-12-2021

Added some new functions, overall updated the main code to function and display better.
Added the date and time after the license.

Wanted to add a 'release' function, but this one is held back, since it worked in the first test but broke in the test following the first...

Created an extra return menu, but all these menus have their own variable, so the changes are minimal on creating bugs/other problems.

## 29-11-2021

Update on the 'return to menu' issue/function.
Added a GOTO function to go back to the 'menu.'

Changed the color from yellow to 'Aqua.'
Made some changed to how the code works.

Added an exrta feature to scan and repair right after eachother without making it run again through the menu.

Made a small mistake, didn't added the 'number 5' as an option in the code, so users that aren't familiar with the program wouldn't know they could use the 'number 5' to exit the batch program.

## 23-11-2021

Updated the README.md to tell a user more about the repository and how to use the .bat file.

## 22-11-2021

I have taken a quick look at the code, to see what has to be changed.

## 22-11-2021
